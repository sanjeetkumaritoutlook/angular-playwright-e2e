## Practice:
```
deploying a static website through AWS S3 
1. Created an S3 bucket and uploaded files 
2. Made it public + enabled static website hosting 
3. Hooked up the domain via Route 53
 4. Site went live - but no SSL 
5. Added CloudFront + ACM certificate

AWS calculates a "CPU cycle" or "DB cycle"
