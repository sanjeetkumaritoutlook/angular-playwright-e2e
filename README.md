npx @angular/cli@17 new my-app --no-standalone

## Running end-to-end tests (General)

## Run playwright

npx playwright test

npx playwright show-report

npx playwright show-trace


open browser manually (parallelly run ng serve in another terminal)

npx playwright test --headed

npx playwright test e2e/user-grid.spec.ts --headed


## check if Allure results are actually being generated.

check if the allure-results/ folder is being created 

npx playwright test --reporter=line,allure-playwright

## If you haven't added the Angular Router yet:

ng g m app-routing --flat --module=app

## ðŸŒŸ How to View the Trace?

npx playwright show-trace test-results/<your-test-folder>/trace.zip


## badges/shields in github actions
(main_14104423181_1) is the GitHub Actions run name.

âš¡ But hereâ€™s the difference vs Bamboo:

Bamboo badges let you display a specific build number (483-master+483, etc.).

GitHubâ€™s native workflow badge only shows status (passing / failing), not the run name or run number.


âœ… 1. Build / Test Status Badges
